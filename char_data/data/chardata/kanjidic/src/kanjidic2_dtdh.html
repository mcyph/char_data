&lt;!DOCTYPE kanjidic2 [
	&lt;!-- Version 1.6 - April 2008
	This is the DTD of the XML-format kanji file combining information from
	the KANJIDIC and KANJD212 files. It is intended to be largely self-
	documenting, with each field being accompanied by an explanatory
	comment.

	The file covers the following kanji:
	(a) the 6,355 kanji from JIS X 0208;
	(b) the 5,801 kanji from JIS X 0212;
	(c) the 3,693 kanji from JIS X 0213 as follows:
		(i) the 2,741 kanji which are also in JIS X 0212 have
		JIS X 0213 code-points (kuten) added to the existing entry;
		(ii) the 952 "new" kanji have new entries.

	At the end of the explanation for a number of fields there is a tag
	with the format [N]. This indicates the leading letter(s) of the
	equivalent field in the KANJIDIC and KANJD212 files.

	The KANJIDIC documentation should also be read for additional 
	information about the information in the file.
	--&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT kanjidic2 (header,character*)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT header (file_version,database_version,date_of_creation)&gt;

	The single header element will contain identification information
	about the version of the file 
	--&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT file_version (#PCDATA)&gt;

		classical - as recorded in the KangXi Zidian.
		nelson_c - as used in the Nelson "Modern Japanese-English 
		Character Dictionary" (i.e. the Classic, not the New Nelson).
		This will only be used where Nelson reclassified the kanji.
	--&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT misc (grade?, stroke_count+, variant*, freq?, rad_name*,jlpt?)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT grade (#PCDATA)&gt;

	--&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT freq (#PCDATA)&gt;
	&lt;!-- 
	A frequency-of-use ranking. The 2,500 most-used characters have a 
	ranking; those characters that lack this field are not ranked. The 
	frequency is a number from 1 to 2,500 that expresses the relative 
	frequency of occurrence of a character in modern Japanese. This is
	based on a survey in newspapers, so it is biassed towards kanji
	used in newspaper articles. The discrimination between the less
	frequently used kanji is not strong.
	--&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT rad_name (#PCDATA)&gt;
	&lt;!-- 
	When the kanji is itself a radical and has a name, this element
	contains the name (in hiragana.) [T2]

	information such as page numbers in a number of published dictionaries,
	and instructional books on kanji.
	--&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT dic_ref (#PCDATA)&gt;

	etc. is defined by the dr_type attribute.

	See above under "moro".
	--&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT query_code (q_code+)&gt;

	The q_code contains the actual query-code value, according to the
	qc_type attribute.
	--&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST q_code qc_type CDATA #REQUIRED&gt;
	&lt;!-- 
	The qc_type attribute defines the type of query code. The current values
	are:
	  skip -  Halpern's SKIP (System  of  Kanji  Indexing  by  Patterns) 
	  	code. The  format is n-nn-nn.  See the KANJIDIC  documentation 
	  	for  a description of the code and restrictions on  the 
	  	commercial  use  of this data. [P]  There are also
		a number of misclassification codes, indicated by the
		"skip_misclass" attribute.
	  sh_desc - the descriptor codes for The Kanji Dictionary (Tuttle 
	  	1996) by Spahn and Hadamitzky. They are in the form nxnn.n,  
	  	e.g.  3k11.2, where the  kanji has 3 strokes in the 
	  	identifying radical, it is radical "k" in the SH 
	  	classification system, there are 11 other strokes, and it is 
	  	the 2nd kanji in the 3k11 sequence. (I am very grateful to 
	  	Mark Spahn for providing the list of these descriptor codes 
	  	for the kanji in this file.) [I]
	  four_corner - the "Four Corner" code for the kanji. This is a code 
	  	invented by Wang Chen in 1928. See the KANJIDIC documentation 
	  	for  an overview of  the Four Corner System. [Q]

	  deroo - the codes developed by the late Father Joseph De Roo, and 
	  	published in  his book "2001 Kanji" (Bonjinsha). Fr De Roo 
	  	gave his permission for these codes to be included. [DR]
	  misclass - a possible misclassification of the kanji according
		to one of the code types. (See the "Z" codes in the KANJIDIC
		documentation for more details.)
	  
	--&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST q_code skip_misclass CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
	&lt;!--
	The values of this attribute indicate the type if
	misclassification:
	- posn - a mistake in the division of the kanji
	- stroke_count - a mistake in the number of strokes
	- stroke_and_posn - mistakes in both division and strokes
	- stroke_diff - ambiguous stroke counts depending on glyph
	--&gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT reading_meaning (rmgroup*, nanori*)&gt;
	&lt;!-- 
	The readings for the kanji in several languages, and the meanings, also
	in several languages. The readings and meanings are grouped to enable
	the handling of the situation where the meaning is differentiated by 
	reading. [T1]
	--&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT rmgroup (reading*, meaning*)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT reading (#PCDATA)&gt;
	&lt;!-- 
	The reading element contains the reading or pronunciation
	of the kanji.
	--&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST reading r_type CDATA #REQUIRED&gt;
	&lt;!-- 
	The r_type attribute defines the type of reading in the reading
	element. The current values are:
	  pinyin - the modern PinYin romanization of the Chinese reading 
	  	of the kanji. The tones are represented by a concluding 
	  	digit. [Y]
	  korean_r - the romanized form of the Korean reading(s) of the 
	  	kanji.  The readings are in the (Republic of Korea) Ministry 
	  	of Education style of romanization. [W]
	  korean_h - the Korean reading(s) of the kanji in hangul.
	  ja_on - the "on" Japanese reading of the kanji, in katakana. 
	  	Another attribute r_status, if present, will indicate with
	  	a value of "jy" whether the reading is approved for a
	  	"Jouyou kanji".
		A further attribute on_type, if present,  will indicate with 
		a value of kan, go, tou or kan'you the type of on-reading.
	  ja_kun - the "kun" Japanese reading of the kanji, usually in 
		hiragana. 
	  	Where relevant the okurigana is also included separated by a 
	  	".". Readings associated with prefixes and suffixes are 
	  	marked with a "-". A second attribute r_status, if present, 
	  	will indicate with a value of "jy" whether the reading is 
	  	approved for a "Jouyou kanji".
	--&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST reading on_type CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
	&lt;!-- 
	See under ja_on above.
	--&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST reading r_status CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
	&lt;!-- 
	See under ja_on and ja_kun above.
	--&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT meaning (#PCDATA)&gt;
	&lt;!-- 
	The meaning associated with the kanji.
	--&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST meaning m_lang CDATA #IMPLIED&gt;
	&lt;!-- 
	The m_lang attribute defines the target language of the meaning. It 
	will be coded using the two-letter language code from the ISO 639-1 
	standard. When absent, the value "en" (i.e. English) is implied. [{}]
	--&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT nanori (#PCDATA)&gt;
	&lt;!-- 
	Japanese readings that are now only associated with names.
