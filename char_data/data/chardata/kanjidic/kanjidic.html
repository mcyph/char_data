# TODO: ADD VERSION INFORMATION!

	 Version 1.6 - April 2008
	This is the DTD of the XML-format kanji file combining information from
	the KANJIDIC and KANJD212 files. It is intended to be largely self-
	documenting, with each field being accompanied by an explanatory
	comment.
	
	The file covers the following kanji:
	(a) the 6,355 kanji from JIS X 0208;
	(b) the 5,801 kanji from JIS X 0212;
	(c) the 3,693 kanji from JIS X 0213 as follows:
		(i) the 2,741 kanji which are also in JIS X 0212 have
		JIS X 0213 code-points (kuten) added to the existing entry;
		(ii) the 952 "new" kanji have new entries.

	At the end of the explanation for a number of fields there is a tag
	with the format [N]. This indicates the leading letter(s) of the
	equivalent field in the KANJIDIC and KANJD212 files.

	The KANJIDIC documentation should also be read for additional 
	information about the information in the file.

[rad_value]
	The radical number, in the range 1 to 214. The particular
	classification type is stated in the rad_type attribute.

[rad_type]
	The rad_type attribute states the type of radical classification.
[rad_type-classical]
	as recorded in the KangXi Zidian.
[rad_type-nelson_c]
	as used in the Nelson "Modern Japanese-English 
		Character Dictionary" (i.e. the Classic, not the New Nelson).
		This will only be used where Nelson reclassified the kanji.

[grade]
	The kanji grade level. 1 through 6 indicates a Kyouiku kanji
	and the grade in which the kanji is taught in Japanese schools. 
	8 indicates it is one of the remaining Jouyou Kanji to be learned 
	in junior high school, and 9 or 10 indicates it is a Jinmeiyou (for use 
	in names) kanji. [G]

[stroke_count]
	The stroke count of the kanji, including the radical. If more than 
	one, the first is considered the accepted count, while subsequent ones 
	are common miscounts. (See Appendix E. of the KANJIDIC documentation
	for some of the rules applied when counting strokes in some of the 
	radicals.) [S]

[variant]
	Either a cross-reference code to another kanji, usually regarded as a 
	variant, or an alternative indexing code for the current kanji.
	The type of variant is given in the var_type attribute.
	
	The var_type attribute indicates the type of variant code. The current
	values are: 
		jis208 - in JIS X 0208 - kuten coding
		jis212 - in JIS X 0212 - kuten coding
		jis213 - in JIS X 0213 - kuten coding
		  (most of the above relate to "shinjitai/kyuujitai" 
		  alternative character glyphs)
		deroo - De Roo number - numeric
		njecd - Halpern NJECD index number - numeric
		s_h - The Kanji Dictionary (Spahn & Hadamitzky) - descriptor
		nelson_c - "Classic" Nelson - numeric
		oneill - Japanese Names (O'Neill) - numeric
		ucs - Unicode codepoint- hex

[freq]
	A frequency-of-use ranking. The 2,500 most-used characters have a 
	ranking; those characters that lack this field are not ranked. The 
	frequency is a number from 1 to 2,500 that expresses the relative 
	frequency of occurrence of a character in modern Japanese. This is
	based on a survey in newspapers, so it is biassed towards kanji
	used in newspaper articles. The discrimination between the less
	frequently used kanji is not strong.

[rad_name]
	When the kanji is itself a radical and has a name, this element
	contains the name (in hiragana.) [T2]

[jlpt]
	Japanese Language Proficiency test level for this kanji. Values
	range from 1 (most advanced) to 4 (most elementary). This field 
	does not appear for kanji that are not required for any JLPT level.

[dic_number]
	This element contains the index numbers and similar unstructured
	information such as page numbers in a number of published dictionaries,
	and instructional books on kanji.

[dic_ref]
	Each dic_ref contains an index number. The particular dictionary,
	etc. is defined by the dr_type attribute.

	The dr_type defines the dictionary or reference book, etc. to which
	dic_ref element applies.

	  	identifying radical, it is radical "k" in the SH 
	  	classification system, there are 11 other strokes, and it is 
	  	the 2nd kanji in the 3k11 sequence. (I am very grateful to

	a value of kan, go, tou or kan'you the type of on-reading.
[reading-ja_kun]
	the "kun" Japanese reading of the kanji, usually in 
	hiragana. 
  	Where relevant the okurigana is also included separated by a 
  	".". Readings associated with prefixes and suffixes are

  	will indicate with a value of "jy" whether the reading is 
  	approved for a "Jouyou kanji".

[meaning]
