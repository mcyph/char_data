<h1 align="CENTER"> KANJIDIC2.XML - Overview</h1>
<p>
<b>Introduction</b>
</p>
<p>
The main documentation of the KANJIDIC2.XML is included in the DTD
as comments. This page is just intended as a summary, and may not always be 
up-to-date.
</p>
<p>
The KANJIDIC2 file has the 6,355 kanji from JIS X 0208, the
5,801 kanji from JIS X 0212 and the 3,693 kanji from JIS X 0213 (of
which all but 952 are also in JIS X 0212).
</p>
<p>
At the end of the explanation for a number of fields there is a tag
with the format [N]. This indicates the leading letter(s) of the
equivalent field in the KANJIDIC and KANJD212 files.
</p>
<p>
The 
 <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/%7Ejwb/kanjidic_doc.html">KANJIDIC documentation </a>
should also be read for additional information about the information in the 
file. It also contains information on the 
 <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/%7Ejwb/kanjidic_doc.html#IREF07">history and contributors. </a>

<ul>
<li>the kanji itself coded in Unicode (UTF8)
</li>
<li>the code-point of the kanji.  The values assigned so far are:
<ul>
<li>jis208 - JIS X 0208-1997 - kuten coding (nn-nn)
</li>
<li>jis212 - JIS X 0212-1990 - kuten coding (nn-nn)
</li>
<li>jis213 - JIS X 0213-2000 - kuten coding (p-nn-nn)
</li>
<li>ucs - Unicode 4.0 - hex coding (4 or 5 hexadecimal digits)
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the radical.
<ul>
<li>classical - as recorded in the KangXi Zidian.
</li>
<li>nelson - as used in the Nelson "Modern Japanese-English 
Character Dictionary" (i.e. the Classic, not the New Nelson).
This will only be used where Nelson reclassified the kanji.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>miscellaneous information.
<ul>
<li>The Jouyou Kanji grade level. 1 through 6 indicate the grade in which
the kanji is taught in Japanese schools. 8 indicates it is one of the
remaining Jouyou Kanji to be learned in junior high school, and 9 
indicates it is a Jinmeiyou (for use in names) kanji. [G]
</li>
<li>The stroke count of the kanji, including the radical. If more than 
one, the first is considered the accepted count, while subsequent ones 
are common miscounts. (See Appendix E. of the KANJIDIC documentation
for some of the rules applied when counting strokes in some of the 
radicals.) [S]
</li>
<li>A cross-reference code to another kanji, usually regarded as a variant.
<ul>
<li>jis208 - in JIS X 0208 - kuten coding
</li>
<li>jis212 - in JIS X 0212 - kuten coding
</li>
<li>jis213 - in JIS X 0213 - kuten coding
</li>
<li>deroo - De Roo number - numeric
</li>
<li>njecd - Halpern NJECD index number - numeric
</li>
<li>s_h - The Kanji Dictionary (Spahn &amp; Hadamitzky) - descriptor
</li>
<li>nelson - "Classic" Nelson - numeric
</li>
<li>oneill - Japanese Names (O'Neill) - numeric
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A frequency-of-use ranking. The 2,500 most-used characters have a 
ranking; those characters that lack this field are not ranked. The 
frequency is a number from 1 to 2,500 that expresses the relative 
frequency of occurrence of a character in modern Japanese.
This is based on a survey in newspapers, so it is biassed towards kanji
used in newspaper articles. The discrimination between the less
frequently used kanji is not strong.
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>the name of the radical, when the kanji is itself a radical and has a 
name. [T2]
